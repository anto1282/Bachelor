coverage function doesn't take the reads corresponding to the correct contigs:
Create channel with list of samplerates to feed to subsampling

Increase memory if process cannot run - solution: clear cache

Fix publish dir names, think about if SRA number should follow through all the processes
to make sure we always know what SRA is related to what reads (relevant if we run many different SRA's at once, which we will do)
(Simplify names)

params.phaDB should have a default value
